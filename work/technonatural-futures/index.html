                The bifurcation of human culture and non-human nature is a notion that is pervasive in the Western world. However, it is neither universal nor true. Yet, as long as this perception remains, human society will continue to destroy non-human nature, and along with it, itself. Technonatural Futures is an ongoing series of explorations interrogating existing and alternative relationships between people, nature and technology throughout the past, present and future.

            An imagined product of a future where nature and technology coexist harmoniously and without hierarchy, Poet allows users to communicate with a plant through poetry. In this future, plants are cohabiters rather than objects that are owned. If the plant is happy, if it has been cared for and interacted with, it will respond to touch by generating a poem.
            <br><br>
            With the technologies of today, we are able to give voice to things previously unheard. Throughout history and across cultures, poets have been inspired by and written about nature, from Wordsworth and Keats, to Bai Juyi and Matsuo Bashō. Using machine-generated language to present nature through a poet’s voice, Poet aims to return this sense of wonder and admiration to an audience that no longer pays the same attention to the non-human natural world.
